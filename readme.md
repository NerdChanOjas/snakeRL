# Snake Game RL

This project implements an RL agent that plays the classic Snake game using Deep Q-learning. The agent learns to navigate the game environment and maximize its score by avoiding collisions with walls and its own body while collecting food.

## Features


- A Snake game environment with customizable settings.
- An RL agent trained using Deep Q-learning to play the game.
- Real-time training progress visualization.
- A customizable Deep Q-network model for the agent.
- Integration with Pygame for game rendering.


## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running the Snake Game AI, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x

### Installation

- Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/NerdChanOjas/snakeRL.git
   ```

- Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd snakeRL
    ```

- Install the required Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
## Usage

To run the Snake Game AI, follow these steps:
- Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
- Run the following command to start the game:
    ```bash
    python agent.py
    ```
- Watch the AI agent play the Snake game and learn from its mistakes.


## Documentation

- model.py: Contains the Q-network model and training logic.
- game.py: Defines the Snake game environment and its rules.
- agent.py: Implements the AI agent and training loop.
- helper.py: Provides a function for real-time training progress visualization.



## Training

The AI agent is trained using Deep Q-learning. The training progress is visualized in real-time during the training process. You can adjust hyperparameters and experiment with different configurations to improve the agent's performance.
